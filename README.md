## Architectures for modern data era

Data Lake and Data Warehouse architectures are fundamental to how organizations manage and leverage data in today’s data-driven world. 

What intrigues us is how these systems address different problems—Data Warehouses for structured reporting and Data Lakes for raw, flexible analytics—yet often collaborate inmodern setups. The relevance of these systems to data science lies in their role as the foundation for
storing and preparing data for analysis, machine learning, and insights generation. 

As data enthusiasts, we are driven by a personal curiosity to comprehend how these architectures influence the tools and workflows we might encounter in our future career, particularly as companies increasingly adopt hybrid solutions like Data Lake houses to bridge their strengths. 

Professionally, working with cloud-based data storage solutions such as AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake enables better decision-making and predictive analytics.
